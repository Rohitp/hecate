A new language called Hecate. This readme is more of running notes. This will be updated as things get into it. 

Using Robert Nystroms book a reference -> https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0990582930?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title

Also Nikalaus Wirth's book -> https://docslib.org/doc/9121091/niklaus-wirths-compiler-construction

The language is interpreted, object oriented, dynamic (because surprisingly static typing seems so much more difficult to implement).

It's a regular language -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language, with null.
