[Hecate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate) is a dynamically typed (surprsingly easier to design than static typing), objext oriented, interpreted language written in Java. 

This was written on the back of multiple giants, including

- [Robert Nystrom's amazing book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0990582930?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_tit) on building interpeters
- [Nikalaus Wirth's treatise on compiler design](https://docslib.org/doc/9121091/niklaus-wirths-compiler-construction)
- [The holy bible of compiler design](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201100886)

There are quirks and idiosynchronacies. On purpose (Null is Nietzsche, Variables are initialised to [42](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42) by default). The language is primarilly modelled after python and regretablly, Javacript.

You can use the shell scripts, *build_and_run.sh* and _run.sh_ to execute. You need to pass a text file containing source code as a parameter.

The full language and syntax of the language is too much effort to write down, but I will update this read me, eventually. probably. But check the sample programs in tests to get an understanding till then.
